            <p class="presentacion_contenido_texto">Elon Reeve Muskl…ín is a businessman known for his key roles in Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter (which he rebranded as X).
            Since 2025, he has been a senior advisor to United States president Donald Trump and the de facto head of the 
            Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk is the wealthiest person in the world; as of March 2025, Forbes
            estimates his net worth to be US$320 billion.
            <p class="presentacion_contenido_texto">Born to a prominent family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated to Canada in 1989 when his Canadian citizen 
            was recognized by the government. He moved to the U.S. and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania before 
            moving to California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. After its 
            sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was 
            acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. That year, Musk also became a U.S. citizen.</p>
